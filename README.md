# Math-Project
The idea comes from an assignment I have received from a professor of a Bootcamp class in Finance. I never used before any mathematical equation in neither latex, markdown or rmarkdown. I took initiative to write it in Rmarkdown and then converted the document in pdf to submit it. I learned a lot how to write mathematical languages in rmarkdown and then convert it in latex. 
This is a way to announce that i will keep the same habit and keep share some codes and contents with my fellows.
